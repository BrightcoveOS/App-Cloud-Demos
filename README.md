# App Cloud Demos

This repository contains a variety of [App Cloud][1] code samples. Each 
directory is a standalone template that can be viewed in a WebKit browser 
(e.g. Chrome) or in the Workshop app. In either case, the template should 
be run from a local web server.

Download the Workshop app at http://bit.ly/iworkshop (iOS) or 
http://bit.ly/aworkshop (Android).

See the [App Cloud docs][2] and the [App Cloud discussion group][3] for
more information about any of the techniques you see here.

Additional code samples are available in the App Cloud SDK, which can be 
downloaded from inside [App Cloud Studio][4].
