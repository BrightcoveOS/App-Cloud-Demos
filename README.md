# App Cloud Demos

This repository contains a variety of [App Cloud](http://www.brightcove.com/en/content-app-platform) 
code samples. Each directory is a standalone template that can be viewed in a
WebKit browser (e.g. Chrome) or in the Workshop app. In either case, the
template should be run from a local web server.

Download the Workshop app at http://bit.ly/iworkshop (iOS) or 
http://bit.ly/aworkshop (Android).

See the [App Cloud docs](http://docs.brightcove.com/en/app-cloud/) and the
[App Cloud public mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/bcappcloud) for
more information about any of the techniques you see here.

Additional code samples are available in the App Cloud SDK, which can be downloaded 
from [App Cloud Studio](https://appcloud.brightcove.com/).
