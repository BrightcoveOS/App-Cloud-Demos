# App Cloud Demos

**App Cloud has been discontinued as a product, so this repo is obsolete**

This repository contains a variety of [App Cloud][1] code samples that can be 
previewed in Google Chrome or in the App Cloud Workshop app for [iOS][5] or 
[Android][6].

See the [App Cloud docs][2], [App Cloud Developer Blog][7], and 
[App Cloud discussion group][3] for more information about any of the 
techniques you see here.

Additional code samples are available in the App Cloud SDK, which can be 
downloaded from [App Cloud Studio][4].
