# Geolocation and mapping

This template demonstrates how to access the user's current location and plot
it on a map using the [Google Maps API][1].

## Core Concepts

* Requesting the user's location with `bc.device.getLocation()`
* Displaying a Google Map and sizing it to fit the screen in both landscape
and portrait modes
* Adding a marker to a Google Map
