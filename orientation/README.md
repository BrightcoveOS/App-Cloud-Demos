# Landscape and portrait modes with CSS3 Media Queries and Flexible Box Model 

This template demonstrates how to alter a layout when switching between landscape
and portrait modes using CSS3 [Media Queries](http://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/) 
and [Flexible Box Model](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/flexbox/quick/).

Note: These techniques affect the layout, not the behavior, of a template. You
can listen for a `vieworientationchange` event if you need to perform some
action when the user rotates the device.
