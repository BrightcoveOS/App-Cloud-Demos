# Internationalization (i18n) techniques

This template demonstrates multiple language support at the HTML/JS layer using a 
[JavaScript templating system](https://github.com/adammark/Markup.js), properties 
files, and [parameterized content feeds](http://docs.brightcove.com/en/app-cloud/using-parameters-in-content-feed-urls).

This demo supports English, Spanish and Japanese. To view the template in
Spanish or Japanese, change your device language to Spanish or Japanese and
change your "Region Format" (on iOS) from United States to a Spanish or
Japanese region. (Dates and numbers depend on the region format.)

Note, translations are not yet possible at the container level, meaning you
can't supply multiple sets of labels to the native navigation.
