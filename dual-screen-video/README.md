# Dual Screen Video

This template demonstrates one way to create a dual-screen video app for
Apple TV.

## Core concepts

* Using `bc.device.externalscreen` methods and events to handle communication
between an iPad and Apple TV
* Using the [Brightcove Video Cloud Media API][1]
* Working with the HTML5 `<video>` element
* Handling cases when an Apple TV device is not present or connected, or when 
the target device does not support streaming to Apple TV
